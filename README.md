This html mockup is built with https://ampwebsitebuilder.com/
To implement blocks for the dashboard page and login page please be consistent and use that application (runs on win and mac)
at this stage blocks are ready for the blogs home, and now need to be styled (css and jquery only)

What's needed in the main blog page:
_left dropdown to choose between blogs
_lightbox for images and to edit old posts
_menu and lightbox to add post (needed for the dashboard page also)

Please open an issue for new ideas and proposals
Layouting stage will start once the blocks are positioned in the right template.
